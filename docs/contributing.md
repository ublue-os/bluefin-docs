## Understanding Bluefin's Architecture

### Build System

Bluefin's build process is orchestrated by `just` and defined in the `Justfile`. The core components are:
- **Justfile**: The command runner that orchestrates the entire build process. It defines recipes for building, testing, and cleaning.
- **Containerfile**: A multi-stage container build file that defines the base image layers and executes the main build scripts.
- **Build scripts**: A series of shell scripts located in the `build_files/` directory, organized by image variant (`base`, `dx`) and execution order. These scripts handle package installation, system configuration, and cleanup.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD workflows located in `.github/workflows/` that use `just` to build and publish images.
- **Renovate Bot**: Automated dependency updates for base images and other components.

### Release Channels

| Channel | Purpose | Update Frequency | Fedora Version |
|---------|---------|------------------|----------------|
| **latest** | Daily builds | Multiple times per day | F42 (current) |
| **stable** | Weekly builds | Weekly | F42 |
| **gts** | Grand touring support | Weekly | F41 (GTS) |
| **lts** | Long term support | Weekly | CentOS 10 |

- **DX features**: Issues labeled `dx`

### Branching Strategy

1. **Always branch from main**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Create a descriptive feature branch**:
   ```bash
   # For a bug fix
   git checkout -b fix/cockpit-startup-crash
   
   # For a feature
   git checkout -b feat/add-bazaar-integration
   
   # For documentation
   git checkout -b docs/improve-local-build-guide
   
   # For chores/maintenance
   git checkout -b chore/update-copr-repos
   ```

3. **Branch naming conventions**:
   - `fix/`: Bug fixes
   - `feat/`: New features
   - `docs/`: Documentation changes
   - `chore/`: Maintenance tasks
   - `refactor/`: Code refactoring

```

#### Common Change Types

**1. Adding a Package**

Package management in Bluefin is handled through shell scripts in the `build_files` directory, not a single JSON file. This allows for more complex installation logic and better separation of concerns.

**Process:**

1.  **Identify the correct script**:
    *   For packages in the base image (for all users), edit `build_files/base/04-packages.sh`.
    *   For packages in the Developer Experience (DX) image, edit `build_files/dx/03-packages-dx.sh`.

2.  **Determine the package source**:
    *   **Fedora Repositories**: For packages available in the standard Fedora repositories.
    *   **COPR Repositories**: For packages from a COPR (Cool Other Package Repo).

3.  **Edit the script**:

    *   **For Fedora Packages**:
        Add your package name to the `FEDORA_PACKAGES` array in the appropriate script. Keep the list alphabetized.

        *Example: Adding `htop` to the base image in `build_files/base/04-packages.sh`*
        ```bash
        FEDORA_PACKAGES=(
            # ... other packages
            glow
            gnome-shell-extension-appindicator
            htop  # Add your package here
            gum
            hplip
            # ... other packages
        )
        ```

    *   **For COPR Packages**:
        Use the `copr_install_isolated` helper function. This function enables the COPR, installs the package, and disables it again to prevent conflicts. Add this call after the main `dnf install` command for `FEDORA_PACKAGES`.

        *Example: Adding `my-copr-package` from `user/repo` COPR to the DX image in `build_files/dx/03-packages-dx.sh`*
        ```bash
        # ... after the dnf5 -y install "${FEDORA_PACKAGES[@]}" line

        echo "Installing DX COPR packages with isolated repo enablement..."
        copr_install_isolated "user/repo" "my-copr-package"
        ```

4.  **Excluding a Package**:
    To remove a package, add it to the `EXCLUDED_PACKAGES` array in the same script.

    *Example: Excluding `unwanted-package` from the base image*
    ```bash
    EXCLUDED_PACKAGES=(
        # ... other packages
        unwanted-package
    )
    ```

5.  **Test your changes**:
    After making changes, it's recommended to run a local build to ensure your changes haven't broken the build process. See the "Testing Your Changes" section below.

**3. Adding a Just Recipe**

Create or edit a file in `just/`:
```bash
vim just/60-custom.just
```

Add your recipe:
```make
# Install custom development tool
install-custom-tool:
    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    set -euxo pipefail
    echo "Installing custom tool..."
    toolbox run sudo dnf install -y custom-tool
```

**4. Modifying Build Scripts**

Build scripts are numbered by execution order. Common scripts:
- `04-packages.sh`: Package installation
- `05-override-install.sh`: RPM overrides
- `07-base-image-changes.sh`: System modifications
- `17-cleanup.sh`: Cleanup operations

Always test your changes with a local build (see Testing section).

**5. Adding Flatpaks**

Edit the appropriate flatpak list file:
```bash
# For all Bluefin variants
edit flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list

# For DX variant only
edit flatpaks/system-flatpaks-dx.list
```

Add Flatpak IDs (one per line):
```
com.example.NewApp
```

### Commit Message Format

:::caution Important
Bluefin uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) enforced by CI. Your PR will fail if commit messages don't follow this format!
:::

**Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Testing additions/changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `perf`: Performance improvements

**Examples from Actual Bluefin Commits:**

```bash
# Simple fix
git commit -m "fix: remove cockpit and brew setup functions"

# Feature addition
git commit -m "feat: add bazaar flatpak to default installation"

# Chore with scope
git commit -m "chore(deps): update ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:latest docker digest to 9168d7d"

# Documentation
git commit -m "docs: explain hat wobble"

# Multi-line with explanation
git commit -m "fix: Remove unused terminal and VFIO configurations

These configurations were causing conflicts with default GNOME settings
and are no longer needed with the updated kernel modules."
```

**Commit Message Tips:**
- Keep subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds")
- Don't end subject line with a period
- Provide context in the body for complex changes
- Reference issues with `Fixes #123` or `Closes #456`

### Making the Commit

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add path/to/modified/file.sh

# Or stage all changes
git add .

# Review what you're committing
git diff --cached

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat(just): add custom development tool installer"

# Or use an editor for multi-line commits
git commit
```

### Pushing Changes

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin feat/add-bazaar-integration

# If you need to force push after amending (use with caution)
git push origin feat/add-bazaar-integration --force-with-lease
```

## Testing Your Changes

:::tip Testing is Key
Always test your changes locally or via PR builds before merging. Broken builds affect everyone!
:::

### Local Build Testing

**Option 1: Using `just` (Recommended)**

The `Justfile` provides convenient recipes for building. This is the easiest and recommended way to build locally.

```bash
# Build the base bluefin image for the latest stream
just build bluefin latest main

# Build the developer (dx) variant with nvidia drivers
just build bluefin-dx latest nvidia
```

**Option 2: Full Container Build with `podman`**

If you prefer not to use `just`, you can invoke `podman` directly. This is useful if you don't have `just` installed or need more control over the build arguments.

```bash
# Build the base image
podman build -t bluefin-test:latest .

# Build with specific arguments
podman build \
  --build-arg FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION=42 \
  --build-arg IMAGE_NAME=bluefin \
  -t bluefin-test:latest \
  .
```

**Option 2: Script Testing** (Faster for script changes)

```bash
# Test a specific build script
podman run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd)/build_files:/build_files:ro" \
  ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:42 \
  bash /build_files/base/04-packages.sh
```

**Option 3: GitHub Actions Build** (Use PR builds)

When you open a PR, GitHub Actions automatically builds your changes. Check the Actions tab for:
- Build logs
- Success/failure status
- Build artifacts

### Testing on Your System

:::warning Testing on Your System
Rebasing to PR images is powerful but comes with risk. Always have a backup plan to revert to stable!
:::

**Using PR Images:**

Every PR generates a test image. You can rebase to it:

```bash
# Find the PR number (e.g., #3322)
# Rebase to the PR image
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:pr-3322

# Reboot to test
sudo systemctl reboot

# If it works, leave feedback on the PR
# If it doesn't work, revert to stable
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable
sudo systemctl reboot
```

**Testing Just Recipes:**

```bash
# List available recipes
ujust

# Test your new recipe
ujust install-custom-tool

# Check for errors in the output
```

### Linting and Validation

**Shell Script Linting:**
```bash
# Install shellcheck if not present
brew install shellcheck

# Lint shell scripts
shellcheck build_files/base/*.sh
```

**Container Linting:**
```bash
# Use hadolint for Containerfile
podman run --rm -i hadolint/hadolint < Containerfile
```

**JSON Validation:**
```bash
# Validate packages.json
jq empty packages.json && echo "Valid JSON" || echo "Invalid JSON"
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

:::tip Common Issues & Solutions
Stuck? Check this section first. Most problems have been encountered before and have known solutions!
:::

### Build Failures

**Problem:** Build fails with package conflict
```
Error: package foo conflicts with bar
```

**Solution:**
1. Check if package is already included elsewhere
2. Add exclusion to packages.json
3. Check COPR repository compatibility

**Problem:** Git error during build
```
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/': Could not resolve host
```

**Solution:**
1. Check network connectivity in build environment
2. Verify GitHub Actions has network access
3. Check if rate-limited by GitHub

### Local Testing Issues

**Problem:** Podman build fails with permission error
```
Error: writing blob: adding layer with blob: permissions denied
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run with appropriate permissions
sudo podman build -t test .

# Or configure rootless podman
podman system migrate
```

**Problem:** Out of disk space during build
```
Error: no space left on device
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean up podman storage
podman system prune -a

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### PR Issues

**Problem:** CI check failing - Conventional Commit validation
```
❌ Commit message does not follow Conventional Commits format
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Amend the commit message
git commit --amend

# Update the PR
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

**Problem:** Merge conflict with main
```
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in packages.json
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# Fetch latest upstream
git fetch upstream

# Rebase on main
git rebase upstream/main

# Resolve conflicts manually
vim packages.json

# Mark as resolved
git add packages.json
git rebase --continue

# Force push
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

## Community Interaction

### Communication Channels

**GitHub Issues:**
- Primary venue for bug reports and feature requests
- Use issue templates when available
- Search existing issues before creating new ones

**Discord:**
- Real-time chat for quick questions
- Discord: Check [the documentation](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/communications/) for the server link
- **Remember:** Discord is for chat, not permanent documentation

**Discussion Forum:**
- [community.projectbluefin.io](https://community.projectbluefin.io/)
- Long-form discussions
- Support questions
- Community feedback

### Communication Best Practices

**DO:**
- ✅ Ask questions in issues for permanent record
- ✅ Search before asking
- ✅ Provide context and details
- ✅ Be patient with maintainer response times
- ✅ Help others when you can
- ✅ Thank contributors

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Use Discord for bug reports (file issues instead)
- ❌ Expect immediate responses
- ❌ Ping maintainers directly unless urgent
- ❌ Ask the same question in multiple channels
- ❌ Post "me too" comments without additional info

### Code of Conduct

All contributors must follow the [Universal Blue Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ublue-os/main?tab=coc-ov-file#readme).

**Key Points:**
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Report inappropriate behavior to `jorge.castro@gmail.com`

### Issue Capture Discipline

:::note Issue Capture Philosophy
Use Discord for rapid debugging, but always capture solutions in GitHub issues. This builds permanent, searchable knowledge for the community.
:::

From the contributing guide philosophy:

**The "Issue Capture" Pattern:**
1. **Use Discord for rapid iteration** - Debug quickly in chat
2. **Capture to text editor** - Copy important findings as you go
3. **File an issue** - Create permanent record of solution
4. **Edit and improve** - Clean up the issue description later

**Why This Matters:**
- Solves the problem once for everyone
- Creates searchable documentation
- Prevents asking the same question twice
- Builds institutional knowledge

**Example Flow:**
```
Discord: "Hey, package X is failing to install"
  ↓ (quick back-and-forth debugging)
  ↓ (copy findings to text editor)
  ↓
GitHub Issue: "Package X fails on Fedora 42 due to Y dependency"
  - Symptoms
  - Root cause
  - Solution
  - Related links
```

## Contributing to Infrastructure

### GitHub Actions Workflows

**Workflow Structure:**
- `build-image-*.yml`: Per-channel build triggers
- `reusable-build.yml`: Shared build logic
- `clean.yml`: Artifact cleanup
- `generate-release.yml`: Release notes

**Making Workflow Changes:**

```bash
# Edit workflow file
vim .github/workflows/build-image-stable.yml

# Validate syntax locally
# Use GitHub's workflow validator or:
yamllint .github/workflows/build-image-stable.yml

# Commit
git add .github/workflows/build-image-stable.yml
git commit -m "chore(ci): improve stable build caching"

# Test in your fork first
git push origin your-branch
# Open PR from fork to see if it works
```

**Common Workflow Patterns:**

```yaml
# Conditional execution
- name: Build only on main
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  run: ./build.sh

# Matrix builds
strategy:
  matrix:
    variant: [bluefin, bluefin-dx]
    fedora: [41, 42]
```

### Build Script Development

**Script Organization:**
- `00-09`: Early stage (kernel, repos, packages)
- `10-16`: Mid stage (configuration, additions)
- `17-19`: Late stage (cleanup, initramfs)

**Script Template:**

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
set -eoux pipefail

echo "::group:: Your Script Name"

# Your logic here
# Use $FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION for version-specific logic
# Use $IMAGE_NAME for image-specific logic

echo "::endgroup::"
```

**Testing Scripts:**

```bash
# Direct execution (for simple scripts)
bash -x build_files/base/04-packages.sh

# Container execution (more realistic)
podman run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspace:ro" \
  -e FEDORA_MAJOR_VERSION=42 \
  ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main:42 \
  bash /workspace/build_files/base/04-packages.sh
```

## Release Process

### Understanding Releases

Bluefin uses continuous delivery:
- **Daily builds**: Automatic, no manual release
- **Version format**: `42.20251012.1` (Fedora.YYYYMMDD.build)
- **Multiple builds per day**: Various channels updated independently

### Release Channels

**stable** (Weekly):
```bash
# Rebase to stable
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:stable
```

**latest** (Daily):
```bash
# Rebase to latest
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:latest
```

**gts** (LTS):
```bash
# Rebase to GTS (Long Term Support)
sudo bootc switch ghcr.io/ublue-os/bluefin:gts
```

## Pinning Package Versions

:::caution Temporary Workarounds Only
Package pins are temporary workarounds for upstream regressions. Always document why they exist and remove them after the fix is released!
:::

Sometimes upstream Fedora has a regression requiring a temporary pin.

**Add a Pin:**

Edit the appropriate Containerfile section:
```dockerfile
# Revert to older version of ostree to fix Flatpak installations
RUN rpm-ostree override replace \
    https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2023-cab8a89753
```

**Document the Pin:**
```bash
# Add comment explaining:
# - What's pinned
# - Why it's pinned
# - Link to upstream bug
# - When to remove (after fix is released)
```

**Remove a Pin:**

Wait 24-48 hours after Fedora releases a fix (for rebuild propagation), then:
```bash
# Remove the override
git diff Containerfile
# Confirm the pin is removed
git commit -m "chore: remove ostree pin after upstream fix"
```

## Flatpak Management in Bluefin

### 1. Upstream to Flathub

Bluefin does not host its own Flatpak repository. All graphical applications must first be published on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/). To contribute a new Flatpak:

- Ensure your application meets [Flathub’s technical and legal requirements](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/requirements).
- Prepare a Flatpak manifest and test local builds using `flatpak-builder`.
- Submit your application to Flathub by forking the [flathub/flathub](https://github.com/flathub/flathub) repository, creating a new branch, adding your manifest and required files, and opening a pull request against the `new-pr` branch. Follow the [submission guide](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission).
- Respond to reviewer feedback and iterate as needed. Once approved, your app will be published on Flathub and available to Bluefin users.

### 2. Flatpak Quality and Maintenance

Maintain your Flatpak by following [Flathub’s maintenance guidelines](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/maintenance). This includes updating runtimes, responding to build failures, and ensuring metadata quality. Applications that pass all quality checks are more likely to be featured both on Flathub and in downstream curated stores like Bazaar.

## Managing System Flatpaks in Bluefin

System-wide Flatpaks in Bluefin are managed through configuration files that list the Flatpak application IDs to be installed by default. These files are:

- `/etc/ublue-os/system-flatpaks.list` for standard system Flatpaks
- `/etc/ublue-os/system-flatpaks-dx.list` for developer mode Flatpaks

To propose changes (add, update, or remove Flatpaks):

1. Edit the relevant list file in the Bluefin repository (`flatpaks/system-flatpaks.list` or `flatpaks/system-flatpaks-dx.list`) and add or remove Flatpak IDs as needed. Each line should contain a single Flatpak app ID, for example:
   ```
   app/org.mozilla.firefox
   app/org.gnome.Calculator
   ```
2. Submit a pull request with your changes. Maintainers will review and merge as appropriate.

During system provisioning or updates, Bluefin installs or updates all Flatpaks listed in these files using the following logic:
```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --system flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
xargs flatpak --system -y install --or-update < /etc/ublue-os/system-flatpaks.list
# Developer mode Flatpaks are installed if developer mode is enabled
xargs flatpak --system -y install --or-update < /etc/ublue-os/system-flatpaks-dx.list
```

## Featuring Flatpaks in Bazaar

Bazaar’s featured sections are defined in a YAML configuration file:  
`system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/bazaar/config.yaml`

Each section (e.g., "Bluefin Recommends", "Browsers", "Media") contains an `appids` list specifying which Flatpaks appear in that section. To feature a Flatpak:

1. Ensure the Flatpak is available on Flathub and not present in the Bazaar blocklist (`system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/bazaar/blocklist.txt`).
2. Edit `config.yaml` and add the Flatpak’s app ID to the `appids` list of the desired section. For example:
   ```yaml
   sections:
     - title: "Bluefin Recommends"
       appids:
         - org.mozilla.firefox
         - org.gnome.Calculator
         - com.example.YourApp   # <-- Add your app here
   ```
3. Optionally, create a new section if your application fits a new category.
4. Submit a pull request with your changes. The Bazaar maintainers will review and merge as appropriate.

## Lifecycle Management

### Updates

- Flatpaks are updated automatically from Flathub. When a new version is published on Flathub, Bluefin systems will receive the update during the next system Flatpak update cycle.
- To update a Flatpak’s version, update it on Flathub. No changes are needed in Bluefin unless the app ID changes or the app is removed.

### Removals

- To remove a Flatpak from Bluefin’s default install, delete its entry from the relevant system Flatpak list file and/or from Bazaar’s `config.yaml`.
- To remove a Flatpak from Flathub, follow [Flathub’s end-of-life process](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/maintenance#end-of-life).

### Blocklisting

- Some Flatpaks are explicitly excluded from Bazaar via the `blocklist.txt` file. Do not add blocklisted app IDs to Bazaar’s featured sections.

### Maintenance Responsibility

- Flatpak maintainers are responsible for keeping their applications up to date on Flathub.
- Bluefin maintainers review and merge changes to system Flatpak lists and Bazaar configuration.




## Fedora Upstream Reporting

### When to Report Upstream

If you find a bug that:
- Exists in vanilla Fedora Silverblue/Kinoite
- Is not caused by Bluefin modifications
- Affects the base Fedora Atomic system

### How to Report Upstream

1. **Reproduce on vanilla Fedora** (if possible):
   ```bash
   # Boot vanilla Fedora Silverblue
   # Test if the issue occurs there
   ```

2. **Report to Fedora**:
   - Upstream tracker: [fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker](https://github.com/fedora-silverblue/issue-tracker/issues)
   - Include: Fedora version, steps to reproduce, logs

3. **Link in Bluefin Issue**:
   - Cross-reference the upstream issue
   - Track upstream progress
   - Help test fixes

:::

1. **Start small**: Begin with documentation or simple package additions
2. **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification
3. **Test thoroughly**: Use local builds or PR images
4. **Be patient**: Reviews take time; maintainers balance multiple priorities
5. **Learn from others**: Read merged PRs to understand patterns
6. **Follow conventions**: Stick to established patterns in the codebase
7. **Document your work**: Help future contributors with clear explanations

Remember: Every maintainer started as a first-time contributor. Welcome to the Bluefin community!
