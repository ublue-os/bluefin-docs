Bluefin is designed to be used by normal people, but the command line is our _**passion**_. Therefore we invest in the command line experience, knowing that most people will never see it. Slay out.

## Installing Applications

[brew](https://brew.sh/) (Also known as Homebrew) is the package manager used for installing command line applications.

- [Homebrew Documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/)
- [Homebrew Packages](https://formulae.brew.sh/)
- [Cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/homebrew)

Note that the cask functionality in homebrew is macOS specific and non functional in Bluefin, Flatpak is used instead. Other package management tools like [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), [pixi](https://github.com/prefix-dev/pixi), [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/), and [mise](https://github.com/jdx/mise) are available and work perfectly fine when installed via homebrew. Package managers inside of package managers ... hey look it was like that when we got here, this one isn't our fault! They do work great though, and some users may prefer those tools, so you have the option to forge your own path.

:::info[Don't cross the streams]

Generally speaking, if you need a tool or utility, use homebrew. If you need a library and dependencies for development work, use a container. This keeps everything nice and clean.

### `bluefin-cli`

`ujust bluefin-cli` will install Bluefin's opt-in command line experience using modern tools with great features that make us more efficient. It is designed to be turned on and off.

:::tip[A greenfield terminal experience]

We love our command line tools. This is intended to be a rendition of what a brand new terminal experience would look like with modern tooling. The traditional tooling is always a toggle away. Keep up with the cool kids without sacrificing your "known good" kit.

### Bold Brew

[Bold Brew](https://bold-brew.com/) is included as a text based user interface (TUI) to Brew. This application features full package management for homebrew in a nice nerdy interface:

### Message of the Day and `fastfetch`

The project prefers to have functional bling that is slick but it must also serve a purpose. New terminals (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) display a message of the day with some basic information:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0326ef-6640-41a2-bd24-dae1b1647cfd)

The `bluefin-dx:beta` line is the name of the OS image, and is a good way to remind yourself if you're on a pinned image as well as a quick reference to common commands. You can toggle it on and off with `ujust toggle-user-motd`. Note that the Tip rotates regularly in order to spread useful tips to the community.

We love to flex our machines and software. Run `fastfetch`:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f720f9d8-7c3c-4f3c-9112-c627686e0fb1)

This screen will show you hardware information, as well as your username, machine name, and kernel version. Each Bluefin image has a "Forged On" date, commemorating the initial installation of the machine.

:::tip[Of course it does]

Note that the terminal color scheme will automatically match [your desktop accent color](https://release.gnome.org/47/). Restart your terminal after setting the color for the setting to apply.

## Terminal Configuration

### Changing the default terminal shell

Bluefin uses [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) by default but also ships with [fish](https://fishshell.com/) ([Donate](https://github.com/sponsors/fish-shell)) and [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/) on the image for convenience.

:::note[Help Wanted]

The Bluefin team lacks expertise in both fish and zsh, contributions to help us reach feature parity would be welcome and appreciated!

:::

Bluefin ships [Ptyxis](https://devsuite.app/ptyxis/) as the default terminal. It shows up as `Terminal` in the menu. It is **strongly recommended** that you [change your shell via the terminal emulator instead of system-wide](https://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2023/12/22/dont-change-defaut-login-shell/). Click on the Terminal settings and edit your profile:

![Ptyxis → Preferences → Profiles → A Profile Setting → Edit...](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c122205-dbd8-41e6-8b7b-4f536c3b69e9)

Then select "Use Custom Command" and then add the shell you want to use. `/usr/bin/fish` and `/usr/bin/zsh` are both included on the image:

![Ptyxis → Preferences → Profiles → A Profile Setting → Edit... → Shell → Custom Command](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eb039db-7ec1-4847-b3d7-496d69fe9538)

### Using `bluefin-cli` with alternate shells

You can enable `bluefin-cli` for `fish` or `zsh` by pre-pending an override to the `$SHELL` variable to the command with:

```
SHELL=fish ujust bluefin-cli
SHELL=zsh ujust bluefin-cli
# Or do it all at once from bash with
ujust bluefin-cli && SHELL=fish ujust bluefin-cli && SHELL=zsh ujust bluefin-cli
```

## Fonts

Homebrew is also used for installing fonts, browse [this page](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask-font/) and install your favorite fonts. They will be copied into `~/.local/share/fonts`

- Microsoft Fonts: Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/colindean/homebrew-fonts-nonfree) to install Office fonts if you need them. You can skip the homebrew installation instructions since it is installed already.
