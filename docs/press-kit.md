# Press Kit

Thanks for generating content about Bluefin and Universal Blue! This document will explain how to use the brand and terminology used by the project.

- [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io)
- [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org)
- [Introductory Blog Post](https://www.ypsidanger.com/announcing-project-bluefin/) - this has the backstory and background information

# Bluefin Terminology

The name of the project is `Project Bluefin` but usually shortened to just `Bluefin`. It is built with [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), which publishes base images that Bluefin uses. These in turn are derived from Fedora's Silverblue images. Universal Blue is the parent organization of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev), and [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore). It also acts as the GitHub organization.

## Proper Usage

- `Bluefin` - used to refer to the project and/or the operating system
- `Bluefin GTS` - used to refer to the GTS version of Bluefin specifically. This is the default experience
- `Bluefin DX` - Bluefin with developer mode turned on, relevant when discussing developer-specific features
- `Bluefin GDX` - Bluefin with developer mode turned on, and Nvidia specific tooling like CUDA. Relevant when discussing AI-specific features

## Incorrect Usage

- `BluefinOS` `Bluefin OS` or `Bluefin Linux` - or any other addition of to the name, it's just `Bluefin`
- `Fedora Bluefin` - this implies a formal relationship between Fedora and Bluefin. Check the [mission document](https://universal-blue.org/mission.html) for more information about the relationship between Fedora and Universal Blue
- `Atomic` or any variation - this is a Fedora brand name and unrelated to Bluefin
   - Addressing them both as Atomic weakens Fedora's brand, so a collective way to address them as a group would be cloud-native operating systems or just bootc images. Or just bootable containers, don't overthink it. bootc is the technology we all depend on and we should ensure that it is the #1 brand when it comes to this style of Linux. 
   - Addressing them as "atomics" is wholey inappropriate unless you are Paul Atreides
- `Universal Blue Bluefin` or `uBlue Bluefin` - "Bluefin is built with Universal Blue" or "Bluefin is a Universal Blue image" is recommended instead.
- "Immutable Distribution" - Bluefin is an operating system, it is neither immutable nor a distribution, it is a custom image that is a collection of distributions: Flathub, Homebrew, and Fedora

# Universal Blue Terminology

## Proper Usage

- `Universal Blue` - used to refer to the Universal Blue Project, the GitHub organization, or the collective set of maintainers

## Incorrect Usage

- `uBlue`, `UBlue`, `ublue-os`, or any contraction of the term

`ublue-os` is used as convenience slugs in URLs or paths in the operating system such as `/usr/share/ublue-os`

Also when dealing with communicating to end users, we want the word Universal to be repeated when mentioning the project. Invisible layer to the end user so that the focus can go on universal solutions for everyone. 

# Governance

All Universal Blue images share governance structures and are modelled after cloud native projects such as Kubernetes:
