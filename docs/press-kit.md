# Press Kit

Thanks for generating content about about Bluefin and Universal Blue! This document will explain how to use the brand and terminology used by the project.

- [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io)
- [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org)
- [Introductory Blog Post](https://www.ypsidanger.com/announcing-project-bluefin/) - this has the backstory and background information

# Bluefin Terminology

The name of the project is `Project Bluefin` but usually shortened to just `Bluefin`. It is built with [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), which publishes base images that Bluefin uses. These in turn are derived from Fedora's Silverblue images. Universal Blue is the parent organization of [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), [Aurora](https://getaurora.dev), and [uCore](https://github.com/ublue-os/ucore). It also acts as the GitHub organization.

## Proper Usage

- `Bluefin` - used to refer to the project and/or the operating system
- `Bluefin GTS` - used to refer to the GTS version of Bluefin specifically. This is the default experience
- `Bluefin DX` - Bluefin with developer mode turned on, relevant when discussing developer-specific features
- `Bluefin GDX` - Bluefin with developer mode turned on, and Nvidia specific tooling like CUDA. Relevant when discussing AI-specific features

## Incorrect Usage

- `BluefinOS` - or any addition of "OS" to the name
- `Fedora Bluefin` - this implies a formal relationship between Fedora and Bluefin. Check the [mission document](https://universal-blue.org/mission.html) for more information about the relationship between Fedora and Universal Blue
- `Universal Blue Bluefin` or `uBlue Bluefin` - "Bluefin is built with Universal Blue" or "Bluefin is a Universal Blue image" is recommended instead.
- "Immutable Distribution" - Bluefin is an operating system, it is neither immutable nor a distribution, it is a custom image based on Fedora.

# Universal Blue Terminology

## Proper Usage

- `Universal Blue` - used to refer to the Universal Blue Project, the GitHub organization, or the collective set of maintainers

## Incorrect Usage

- `uBlue`, `UBlue`, `ublue-os`, or any contraction of the term. These shorthand names are commonly used as convenience slugs in URLs or paths in the operating system such as `/usr/share/ublue-os`

# Governance

All Universal Blue images share governance structures and are modelled after cloud native projects such as Kubernetes:
