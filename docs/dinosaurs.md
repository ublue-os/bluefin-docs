Bluefin features dinosaurs and other prehistoric life in its artwork. Bluefin has friends, we call this Bluefin's [kettle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kettle_(birds)>). All the creatures here are designed and drawn by Jacob Schnurr. You can buy stickers to these and many more designs at [his Etsy store](https://www.etsy.com/shop/JSchnurrCommissions?dd_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F). See also: [Why dinosaurs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpKFcLqbd-A&t=2451s)?

Here are the cast of characters! Each represent something important to this ecosystem.
