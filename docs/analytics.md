The Fedora countme service is on by default in Fedora, and we inherit that behavior:

- [How to turn it off](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/countme/)

## Homebrew

Homebrew's analytics are on by default. To turn them off:

```
brew analytics off
```

Check the [homebrew documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Analytics) for more information. You can also checkout the [operating system rankings](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/os-version/30d/) as a fun competition.
