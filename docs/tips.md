# Maintainer Recommended Extensions

Here are some GNOME extensions that the maintainers recommend to round out your experience. Remember to support extension authors by donating to the ones you love! Talk to a maintainer before PRing something here as this is an opinionated list. :)

- [Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/) - adds a ton of configuration options in one config app. Useful for config junkies!
- [Tiling Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7065/tiling-shell/) - our recommended Tiling extension
- [Night Theme Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2236/night-theme-switcher/)
- Quick Settings [Audio Hider](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5964/quick-settings-audio-devices-hider/) and [Audio Renamer](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6000/quick-settings-audio-devices-renamer/) - Let's you rename your audio devices so they are human readable instead of model numbers, etc. The Hider then let's you remove inputs/outputs you may not be using, it helps to clean up the menu:

- [Wiggle](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6784/wiggle/) - Another "I want my system to look like a Mac" extension, but honestly it is quite handy for finding your cursor most of the time

- [Control monitor brightness and volume with ddcutil](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6325/control-monitor-brightness-and-volume-with-ddcutil/) - Lengthy name, but for sure really useful! I've never known that my external monitors even had those capabilities before I tested it out.
