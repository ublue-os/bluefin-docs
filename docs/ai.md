# AI and Machine Learning

### Desktop integration

[Install alpaca](https://flathub.org/apps/com.jeffser.Alpaca) to use a native desktop application. Alpaca supports Nvidia and AMD acceleration natively and includes ollama. If you prefer an all-GUI solution just use Alpaca and manage your models from within the application.
