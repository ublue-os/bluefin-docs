## Features

Bluefin features a GNOME ([Donate](https://www.gnome.org/donate/)) desktop configured by our community. It is designed to be hands-off and stay out of your way so you can focus on your applications.

System updates are image-based and automatic. Applications are logically separated from the system by using Flatpaks for graphical applications and `brew` for command-line applications.

:::tip

Bluefin is "An interpretation of the Ubuntu spirit built on Fedora technology"—a callback to an era of Ubuntu's history that many open source enthusiasts grew up with, much like the Classic X-Men. We aim to bring that same vibe here; think of us as the reboot. Chill vibes.

## Upstream Focus

Bluefin specifically ships upstream tools in lieue of custom applications. The idea of a "distribution app store" has proven to be unsustainable for desktop application authors, so Bluefin ships tools like [Bazaar](https://github.com/kolunmi/bazaar) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) instead. Additionally the team purposely ensures that the workflows used in Bluefin remain not only distribution agnostic, but operating system agnostic. For example, `podman`, `docker`, and `flaptak` instead of distribution specific tooling, etc.
