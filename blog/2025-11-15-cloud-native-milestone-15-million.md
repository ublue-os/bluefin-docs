A new report from the CNCF and SlashData reveals a major industry milestone: there are now _15.6 million cloud-native developers_ globally.

This [Q3 2025 "State of Cloud Native Development" study](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cncf_report_stateofcloud_111025a.pdf) shows this group now makes up nearly a third (32%) of all developers worldwide. This explosive growth is driven by the mainstream adoption of projects like Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry, and others. The project we depend on the most, [`bootc`](https://www.cncf.io/projects/bootc/), is a CNCF Sandbox project.

This represents remarkable growth from the [Q1 2025 survey](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Blue-DN29-State-of-Cloud-Native-Development.pdf), which reported 9.2 million cloud-native developers—a 70% increase in just seven months.

:::tip Why this is important to Bluefin

This huge number of developers is why we chose `bootc`, and it's reassuring to know that our development model is continuing to grow so quickly. The explosive growth from 9.2 million developers in April to 15.6 million in November demonstrates the rapid mainstream adoption of cloud-native technologies.
