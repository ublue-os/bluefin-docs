title: "Flex your `fastfetch`"

[renner0e](https://github.com/renner0e) has been cooking on some lightweight bling. The `fastfetch` output on Bluefin (and Aurora) will now include the [weekly checkins](/analytics) of Bluefin systems, as well as weekly installs of Bazaar. This gives us insight to the ballpark number of Bluefin systems and people diving into the pure Flathub experience.

- **Murder Chickens**: Weekly count of Bluefin users.
- **Bazaar Installs**: Weekly count of package installations from Bazaar.

Expect it to land in next week's build, enjoy!
