# Bluefin Docs

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/ublue-os/bluefin-docs)

These docs are pretty sparse on purpose as Bluefin's intended to be invisible. Ideally the docs should be able to be consumed in one sitting.

## Guidelines

- Docs linking to upstream documentation directly with a short summary is preferred.
- There's likely a reason why something is undocumented.

## Previewing your changes

This project uses `just` as a command runner for convenience.

- `just serve`: Build and serve the documentation locally.
- `just build`: Build the documentation.

<summary>Manual setup</summary>

You've made some changes and want to see how they look?

You can install node and run it:

```
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm run start
```

> **Note**: The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is required due to peer dependency conflicts between React versions. If you encounter "Cannot find module" errors (like `xml2js`), make sure you're using this flag during installation.

</details>

Alternatively, you can run the container:

```
docker compose up
```

Then make sure to format all your files with Prettier!

```
npm run prettier
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'xml2js'" error

If you encounter this error when running `npm run start`:

```
Error: Cannot find module 'xml2js'
```

This is typically caused by peer dependency conflicts during installation. To resolve:

1. Remove existing node_modules: `rm -rf node_modules`
2. Install with legacy peer deps: `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
3. Try running the command again: `npm run start`

### Build Requirements

- Node.js 18+ (see `package.json` engines field)
- For production builds, the CI uses `bun` but `npm` works for local development
