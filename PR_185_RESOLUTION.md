# PR #185 Resolution: Docusaurus Monorepo Update Conflict

## Issue Summary

Pull Request #185 was created on May 27, 2025, by Renovate to update the Docusaurus monorepo from v3.7.0 to v3.8.1. However, the PR shows as unmergeable with status "dirty" due to conflicts.

## Root Cause Analysis

The main branch has evolved significantly since the PR was created. The Docusaurus dependencies that PR #185 intended to update have already been updated through subsequent changes to the main branch.

## Current State Comparison

### What PR #185 wanted to update:

- `@docusaurus/core`: 3.7.0 → 3.8.1
- `@docusaurus/faster`: ^3.6.3 → 3.8.1 (this was incomplete in the PR)
- `@docusaurus/preset-classic`: 3.7.0 → 3.8.1
- `@docusaurus/module-type-aliases`: 3.7.0 → 3.8.1
- `@docusaurus/tsconfig`: 3.7.0 → 3.8.1
- `@docusaurus/types`: 3.7.0 → 3.8.1

### Current main branch status:

- ✅ `@docusaurus/core`: 3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED)
- ✅ `@docusaurus/faster`: ^3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED - and properly this time)
- ✅ `@docusaurus/preset-classic`: 3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED)
- ✅ `@docusaurus/module-type-aliases`: 3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED)
- ✅ `@docusaurus/tsconfig`: 3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED)
- ✅ `@docusaurus/types`: 3.8.1 (ALREADY UPDATED)
- ✅ Additional improvements:
  - `@easyops-cn/docusaurus-search-local`: ^0.52.0 (newer than PR's ^0.51.0)
  - `caniuse-lite`: ^1.0.30001727 (new dependency)
  - `prettier`: 3.6.2 (newer than PR's 3.5.3)

## Verification

- ✅ Build test passed: `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ All dependencies are properly installed and up to date
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities in the updated packages

## Resolution

**The PR conflict is resolved by recognizing that the main branch has already achieved the intended updates and more.**

The original goal of PR #185 (updating Docusaurus to v3.8.1) has been completed through subsequent development. The main branch now contains:

1. All the Docusaurus v3.8.1 updates that PR #185 intended to make
2. Additional dependency updates that improve the project
3. A working build system

## Recommendation

This PR can be **closed as resolved** since:

1. The main objective (Docusaurus v3.8.1 update) has been achieved
2. The current main branch is in a better state than what the PR would have provided
3. The build system works correctly with the current dependencies
4. All dependencies are up to date or newer than what the PR proposed

## Technical Details

- The merge conflict occurred because the PR branch diverged from main
- Attempting to rebase would require resolving 903+ commits worth of conflicts
- The simpler and safer approach is to recognize that the work is already done
